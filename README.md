#Simon Game Challenge
Welcome to the Simon Game Challenge! This repository contains a version of the classic memory game, Simon. The goal of the game is to repeat a sequence of flashing colors that the computer generates.

How to Play
Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
The computer will light up one of the four color buttons, and it's your turn to repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the same order.
The game will continue to add one more color to the sequence each round, and you must repeat the entire sequence to progress.
If you make a mistake, the game is over.
The game keeps track of your highest score, so see how many rounds you can complete!
Technologies Used
This Simon Game Challenge was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
