Simon Game Challenge 🎮
Welcome to the Simon Game Challenge! 🎉 This repository contains a version of the classic memory game, Simon. The goal of the game is to repeat a sequence of flashing colors that the computer generates.

Press the "Start" button to begin the game. 💡
The computer will light up one of the four color buttons, and it's your turn to repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the same order. 🎨
The game will continue to add one more color to the sequence each round, and you must repeat the entire sequence to progress. 🔢
If you make a mistake, the game is over. 💥
The game keeps track of your highest score, so see how many rounds you can complete! 💯
